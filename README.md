# Super Sticky Notes App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is the final project of the Skillcrush Introduction to React JS course.
I have designed the app in Adobe XD from scratch and created the CSS styles.

## Description

Users can add, edit and delete notes.
Users can search for notes.
Notes are saved after a user closes and reopens the app.
